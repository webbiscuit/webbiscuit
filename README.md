### Hi there 👋 I am a Dan

Here you will find a random collection of barely started projects and terrible ideas.

All of my software is created with human intelligence. This is a vibe-free zone.

I know C++, python, C#, typescript, Rust.

**My current Dev Setup**

WSL Ubuntu on Windows. Visual Code. CoPilotless.

**Website**

The most over engineered webpage in the world
https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website

**Showcase**

A minimal event-based ledger system. Uses Rust and Axum.

**Templates**

My clean, conda based jupyter template. Get up and running with a new python env quickly.

**Chess**

Maybe I can write something that will make me less awful at chess...
