### Hi there 👋 I am a Dan

Here you will find a random collection of barely started projects and terrible ideas. I build things for fun and learning.

All of my software is created with human intelligence. This is a vibe-free zone.

## What I Work With

C++, Python, C#, TypeScript, Rust.  
Mostly Rust in my spare time. It scratches a nice itch.

Current setup:  
WSL Ubuntu on Windows. Visual Code. CoPilotless.

## Featured Projects

### **Event-Based Ledger (Rust + Axum)**
A minimal event-sourced banking ledger.  
Domain-driven, invariant-heavy, and actually quite tidy.

### **Ridiculously Over-Engineered Personal Website**
A website that should have taken 10 minutes, but didn't.

Trying to write code that will make me less awful at chess.  
No breakthroughs yet.

### **Markov Kafka**
What happens when you feed Kafka into a Markov chain?  
Speak to the dead using Python, kinda.
